## Andrea Di Antonio, 24

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio, a 24-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

### Physics and Mathematics.

I have a BSc in Physics from UniMiB and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations such as FEM.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes.
- Modelling.

### Development.

As of now, I'm working on the following projects:
- [**ivo**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/ivo): A `C++23` [DGFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method) library for `2+1` space-time problems, developed as part of my master's thesis.
- [**CLAY**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/CLAY): A `C23` **L**inear **A**lgebra librar**Y**, developed as part of a Numerical Linear Algebra course.
