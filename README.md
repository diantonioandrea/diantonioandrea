### Andrea Di Antonio, 22

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio, a 22 years old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca.  
I'm currently occupied in:

* Stochastic processes.
* Optimal Control theories.
* Convex Analysis.

As a hobby I enjoy coding simple programs to solve everyday problems and challenge myself to improve even more.  
My go-to language is Python.
I'm even trying to keep my blog [diantonioandrea.com](https://diantonioandrea.com) as updated as possible with posts on my life, hobbies and even studies.
