# Andrea Di Antonio, 24

Hi, I'm Andrea, a 24-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

## Interests

At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations.
    - Discontinuous Galërkin methods.
- Numerical Linear Algebra.
    - Eigenvalues algorithms.
    - Iterative solvers and preconditioning techniques.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes.

## Development

### Current Projects

I am currently focusing on the following projects:
- [**ivo**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/ivo): A [DGFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method) library for `2+1` space-time problems, written in `C++23`, and developed as part of my **master's thesis** at _UniMiB_.

### Notable Past Projects

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:
- [**NAQRA**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/NAQRA), _**N**eon **A**ccelerated **QR** **A**lgorithm_: An implementation of the [_QR Algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithm) with _Double Wilkinson's Shift_ utilizing [_Neon_](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon) intrinsics, written in `C23`.

### University Projects

The following are additional projects completed as part of my academic journey:
- [**pacs-project**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/pacs-project): An implementation of the hp-adaptive discontinuous Galërkin method, written in `C++20`, and developed as part of the exam for the **Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing** course at _PoliMi_.
- [**mnaedp-project**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/mnaedp-project): An implementation of the Crouzeix-Raviart Element for the Stokes problem method, written in `MATLAB`, and developed as part of the exam for the **Advanced Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations** course at _UniMiB_.
- [**maa-homeworks**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/maa-homeworks): Some road traffic simulations, written in `Python 3`, and developed as part of the exam for the **Mathematical Analysis Methods** course at _UniMiB_.
