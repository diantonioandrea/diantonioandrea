## Andrea Di Antonio, 23

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio, a 23-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

### Physics and Mathematics.

I have a BSc in Physics from UniMiB and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations such as Finite Element Methods.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes with applications in Finance.
- Modelling.

### Development.

As a hobby, I enjoy coding simple programs to solve everyday problems and challenging myself to improve even more; my go-to languages are **Python** and **C++**.
