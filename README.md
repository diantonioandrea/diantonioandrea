# Andrea Di Antonio, 24

Hi, I’m Andrea, a Mathematics MSc graduate from the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB.

## Interests

At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations.
    - Discontinuous Galërkin methods.
- Numerical Linear Algebra.
    - Eigenvalues algorithms.
    - Iterative solvers and preconditioning techniques.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes.

## Development

<!-- ### Current Projects

### Notable Past Projects

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:
- [**ivo**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/ivo): A discontinuous Galërkin library for `2+1` space-time problems, written in `C++23`, and developed as part of my **master's thesis** at _UniMiB_.
