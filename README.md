### Andrea Di Antonio, 22

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio, a 22 years old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca.  
As a hobby I enjoy coding simple programs to solve everyday problems and challenge myself to improve even more. My go-to language is Python.

My current projects are:

* [CLIbrary](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/CLIbrary): A standardized collection of CLI utilities written in Python to handle commands, I/O and files.
* [openBriefcase](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/openBriefcase): Accounting utility written in Python and built with CLIbrary.
* [openTree](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/openTree): Genealogy utility written in Python and built with CLIbrary.
