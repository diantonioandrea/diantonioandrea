## Andrea Di Antonio, 23

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio, a 23-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

### Physics and Mathematics.

I have a BSc in Physics from UniMiB and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations such as FEM.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes.
- Modelling.

### Development.

As of now, I'm working on a `C++20+` library for the space-time discontinuous GalÃ«rkin method, applied to convection, diffusion, and reaction problems, as part of my master's thesis.
