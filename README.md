# Andrea Di Antonio, 24

Hi, I'm Andrea, a 24-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

## Physics and Mathematics.

I have a BSc in Physics from UniMiB and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics:
- Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations such as **DG**.
- Numerical Linear Algebra.
- Probability and Stochastic Processes.

## Development.

### Current Projects

I am currently focusing on the following projects:
- [**ivo**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/ivo): A [DGFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method) library for `2+1` space-time problems, written in `C++23`, and developed as part of my master's thesis.

### Notable Past Projects

Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:
- [**NAQRA**](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/NAQRA), _**N**eon **A**ccelerated **QR** **A**lgorithm_: An implementation of the [_QR Algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithm) with _Double Wilkinson's Shift_ utilizing [_Neon_](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon) intrinsics, written in `C23`, and developed as part of a Numerical Linear Algebra course.
