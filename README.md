## Andrea Di Antonio, 23

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio and I am a 23-year-old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

### Physics and Mathematics.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Physics from UniMiB and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics.
* Numerical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations.
* Probability and Stochastic Processes.
* Modelling.

### Development.

As a hobby, I enjoy coding simple programs to solve everyday problems and challenging myself to improve even more; my go-to language is Python.
