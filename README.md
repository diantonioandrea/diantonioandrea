## Andrea Di Antonio, 22

Hi, I'm Andrea Di Antonio and I am a 22 years old Mathematics MSc student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, UniMiB. 

### Past and current studies.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Physics from UniMiB and I'm currently attending a Master of Science in Mathematics.  
At the moment, I am exploring the following topics.
* Numerical Analysis.
* Probability and Stochastic Processes.
* Modelling.
* Optimization.

### My GitHub profile.

As a hobby I enjoy coding simple programs to solve everyday problems and challenge myself to improve even more. My go-to language is Python.  
I'm currently working on:
* [CLIbrary](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/CLIbrary): A standardized collection of CLI utilities written in Python to handle commands, I/O and files.
* [openBriefcase](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/openBriefcase): Accounting utility written in Python and built with CLIbrary.
* [openTree](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/openTree): Genealogy utility written in Python and built with CLIbrary.
